title: Tabelle
description: Pretty sortable and filterable tables

With Tabelle we've chosen an approach to create minimal CSS which will try
to create a decent baseline style so that it isn't completely ugly, but
will be easy to override in the context of your application.

This is because you will almost certainly _want_ to override these styles.
In every project that we have, we usually have a corporate design or personal
design that we want to implement. This means that we simply leave a lot of
the HTML elements completely unstyled because we expect that you will want
to use your styles for input fields.
